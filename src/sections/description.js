Scikit-Pierre is a library written in Python to work with post-processing recommendations. Pierre-In-Frame is a framework, also written in Python, that works as a how-to-use the Scikit-Pierre. The Project Pierre is a product of the doctoral degree in Computer Science of Diego CorrÃªa. Thus, Pierre is a free library and framework and has no direct grant, i.e., it is made with love, science and code.',
